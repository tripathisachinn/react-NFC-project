# react-NFC-project
You just saw your father's Credit Card on the Study Table in the morning with a small WiFi symbol on it. You got curious and came to know about Near Field Communication (NFC) and wanted to test it on your own being a Tech Freak!

So, design a WebApp with a stunning UI as well to read and write various data from NFC Cards and display them on the Web Interface.

If the device doesn't have the required hardware, show a suitable error message.
